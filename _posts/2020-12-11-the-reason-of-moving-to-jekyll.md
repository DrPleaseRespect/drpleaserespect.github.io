# WHY
The reason why I moved to Jekyll is that, it's just easier to maintain than the Google Sites Page that I used. I can also use the URL that's been provided by Github rather than just redirecting my Github URL to the Google Sites Page. the old site if still available is found here: [OLD SITE](https://sites.google.com/view/drpleaserespectprojects/home)


# My Plans
My Plans are to slowly transfer all of my projects in the Google Sites Page to here. I'm still planning to categorize them by their Series Names. If I managed to successfully transfer all of them I will shutdown the Google Sites Page and only release all of my projects in this site.
