# What is this?
This is a backup of [docs.aegisub.org](http://docs.aegisub.org/).
I found a backup of the website while searching for Aegisub's Documentation
and for some reason the website doesn't work. So I searched for backups and I found a Reddit post that has a Google Drive link. I downloaded it and checked it and it's legit so I created a Github Pages page for it.
